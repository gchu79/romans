So they are without excuse. <span class="verse"><sup>21 </sup></span>For although they knew <span class="group2">God</span>, they did not honor him as <span class="group2">God</span> or give thanks to him, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. <span class="verse"><sup>22 </sup></span>Claiming to be wise, they became fools, <span class="verse"><sup>23 </sup></span>and exchanged the glory of the immortal <span class="group2">God</span> for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.

Amen.
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>26 </sup></span>For this reason <span class="group2">God</span> gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> are contrary to nature; <span class="verse"><sup>27 </sup></span>and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.

They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, <span class="verse"><sup>30 </sup></span>slanderers, haters of <span class="group2">God</span>, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, <span class="verse"><sup>31 </sup></span>foolish, <span class="group7"><span class="group7">faith</span></span>less, heartless, ruthless. <span class="verse"><sup>32 </sup></span>Though they know <span class="group2">God</span>'s righteous decree <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> give approval to those who practice them.

<b>9</b> I am speaking the truth in <span class="group5">Christ</span>—I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy <span class="group10">Spirit</span>— <span class="verse"><sup>2 </sup></span><span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> I have great sorrow and uncea<span class="group6"><span class="group6">sin</span></span>g anguish in my heart. <span class="verse"><sup>3 </sup></span>For I could wish <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> I myself were accursed and cut off from <span class="group5">Christ</span> for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh. <span class="verse"><sup>4 </sup></span>They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the <span class="group4">law</span>, the worship, and the promises. <span class="verse"><sup>5 </sup></span>To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the <span class="group5">Christ</span>, who is <span class="group2">God</span> over all, blessed forever. Amen.
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>6 </sup></span>But it is not as though the word of <span class="group2">God</span> has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, <span class="verse"><sup>7 </sup></span>and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> “Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.” <span class="verse"><sup>8 </sup></span>This means <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of <span class="group2">God</span>, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> the children of the promise are counted as offspring. <span class="verse"><sup>9 </sup></span>For this is what the promise said: “About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son.” <span class="verse"><sup>10 </sup></span>And not only so, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac, <span class="verse"><sup>11 </sup></span>though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad—in order <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> <span class="group2">God</span>'s purpose of election might continue, not because of works <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> because of him who calls— <span class="verse"><sup>12 </sup></span>she was told, “The older will serve the younger.” <span class="verse"><sup>13 </sup></span>As it is written, “Jacob I loved, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> Esau I hated.”
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>14 </sup></span>What shall we say then? Is there injustice on <span class="group2">God</span>'s part? By no means! <span class="verse"><sup>15 </sup></span>For he says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” <span class="verse"><sup>16 </sup></span>So then it depends not on human will or exertion, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> on <span class="group2">God</span>, who has mercy. <span class="verse"><sup>17 </sup></span>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I have raised you up, <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> I might show my power in you, and <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.” <span class="verse"><sup>18 </sup></span>So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>19 </sup></span>You will say to me then, “Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?” <span class="verse"><sup>20 </sup></span>But who are you, O man, to answer back to <span class="group2">God</span>? Will what is molded say to its molder, “Why have you made me like this?” <span class="verse"><sup>21 </sup></span>Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use? <span class="verse"><sup>22 </sup></span>What if <span class="group2">God</span>, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, <span class="verse"><sup>23 </sup></span>in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory— <span class="verse"><sup>24 </sup></span>even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> also from the Gentiles? <span class="verse"><sup>25 </sup></span>As indeed he says in Hosea,
<br/><br/>
“Those who were not my people I will call ‘my people,’
    and her who was not beloved I will call ‘beloved.’”
<span class="verse"><sup>26 </sup></span>“And in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’
    there they will be called ‘sons of the living <span class="group2">God</span>.’”
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>27 </sup></span>And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved, <span class="verse"><sup>28 </sup></span>for the <span class="group8">Lord</span> will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay.” <span class="verse"><sup>29 </sup></span>And as Isaiah predicted,
<br/><br/>
“If the <span class="group8">Lord</span> of hosts had not left us offspring,
    we would have been like Sodom
    and become like Gomorrah.”
<br/><br/>
<b>Israel's Unbelief</b>
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>30 </sup></span>What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue <span class="group11"><span class="group11">righteousness</span></span> have attained it, <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> is, a <span class="group11"><span class="group11">righteousness</span></span> <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> is by <span class="group7"><span class="group7">faith</span></span>; <span class="verse"><sup>31 </sup></span><span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> Israel who pursued a <span class="group4">law</span> <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> would lead to <span class="group11"><span class="group11">righteousness</span></span> did not succeed in reaching <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> <span class="group4">law</span>. <span class="verse"><sup>32 </sup></span>Why? Because they did not pursue it by <span class="group7"><span class="group7">faith</span></span>, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone, <span class="verse"><sup>33 </sup></span>as it is written,
<br/><br/>
“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense;
    and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”
<br/><br/>
<b>10</b> Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to <span class="group2">God</span> for them is <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> they may be saved. <span class="verse"><sup>2 </sup></span>For I bear them witness <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> they have a zeal for <span class="group2">God</span>, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> not according to knowledge. <span class="verse"><sup>3 </sup></span>For, being ignorant of the <span class="group11"><span class="group11">righteousness</span></span> of <span class="group2">God</span>, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to <span class="group2">God</span>'s <span class="group11"><span class="group11">righteousness</span></span>. <span class="verse"><sup>4 </sup></span>For <span class="group5">Christ</span> is the end of the <span class="group4">law</span> for <span class="group11"><span class="group11">righteousness</span></span> to everyone who believes.
<br/><br/>
<b>The Message of Salvation to All</b>
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>5 </sup></span>For Moses writes about the <span class="group11"><span class="group11">righteousness</span></span> <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> is based on the <span class="group4">law</span>, <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> the person who does the commandments shall live by them. <span class="verse"><sup>6 </sup></span>But the <span class="group11"><span class="group11">righteousness</span></span> based on <span class="group7"><span class="group7">faith</span></span> says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (<span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> is, to bring <span class="group5">Christ</span> down) <span class="verse"><sup>7 </sup></span>“or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’” (<span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> is, to bring <span class="group5">Christ</span> up from the dead). <span class="verse"><sup>8 </sup></span>But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (<span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> is, the word of <span class="group7"><span class="group7">faith</span></span> <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> we proclaim); <span class="verse"><sup>9 </sup></span>because, if you confess with your mouth <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> <span class="group9">Jesus</span> is <span class="group8">Lord</span> and believe in your heart <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> <span class="group2">God</span> raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <span class="verse"><sup>10 </sup></span>For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. <span class="verse"><sup>11 </sup></span>For the Scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” <span class="verse"><sup>12 </sup></span>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same <span class="group8">Lord</span> is <span class="group8">Lord</span> of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him. <span class="verse"><sup>13 </sup></span>For “everyone who calls on the name of the <span class="group8">Lord</span> will be saved.”
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>14 </sup></span>How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? <span class="verse"><sup>15 </sup></span>And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!” <span class="verse"><sup>16 </sup></span>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, “<span class="group8">Lord</span>, who has believed what he has heard from us?” <span class="verse"><sup>17 </sup></span>So <span class="group7"><span class="group7">faith</span></span> comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of <span class="group5">Christ</span>.
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>18 </sup></span>But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for
<br/><br/>
“Their voice has gone out to all the earth,
    and their words to the ends of the world.”
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>19 </sup></span>But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says,
<br/><br/>
“I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation;
    with a foolish nation I will make you angry.”
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>20 </sup></span>Then Isaiah is so bold as to say,
<br/><br/>
“I have been found by those who did not seek me;
    I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.”
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>21 </sup></span>But of Israel he says, “All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”
<br/><br/>
<b>The Remnant of Israel</b>
<br/><br/>
<b>11</b> I ask, then, has <span class="group2">God</span> rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. <span class="verse"><sup>2 </sup></span><span class="group2">God</span> has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to <span class="group2">God</span> against Israel? <span class="verse"><sup>3 </sup></span>“<span class="group8">Lord</span>, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life.” <span class="verse"><sup>4 </sup></span>But what is <span class="group2">God</span>'s reply to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” <span class="verse"><sup>5 </sup></span>So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace. <span class="verse"><sup>6 </sup></span>But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>7 </sup></span>What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> the rest were hardened, <span class="verse"><sup>8 </sup></span>as it is written,
<br/><br/>
“<span class="group2">God</span> gave them a <span class="group10">spirit</span> of stupor,
    eyes <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> would not see
    and ears <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> would not hear,
down to this very day.”
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>9 </sup></span>And David says,
<br/><br/>
“Let their table become a snare and a trap,
    a stumbling block and a retri<span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span>ion for them;
<span class="verse"><sup>10 </sup></span>let their eyes be darkened so <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> they cannot see,
    and bend their backs forever.”
<br/><br/>
<b>Gentiles Grafted In</b>
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>11 </sup></span>So I ask, did they stumble in order <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> they might fall? By no means! Rather, through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous. <span class="verse"><sup>12 </sup></span>Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>13 </sup></span>Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry <span class="verse"><sup>14 </sup></span>in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them. <span class="verse"><sup>15 </sup></span>For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> life from the dead? <span class="verse"><sup>16 </sup></span>If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>17 </sup></span>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree, <span class="verse"><sup>18 </sup></span>do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> the root <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> supports you. <span class="verse"><sup>19 </sup></span>Then you will say, “Branches were broken off so <span class="group1"><span class="group1">that</span></span> I might be grafted in.” <span class="verse"><sup>20 </sup></span>That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> you stand fast through <span class="group7"><span class="group7">faith</span></span>. So do not become proud, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> fear. <span class="verse"><sup>21 </sup></span>For if <span class="group2">God</span> did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. <span class="verse"><sup>22 </sup></span>Note then the kindness and the severity of <span class="group2">God</span>: severity toward those who have fallen, <span class="group3"><span class="group3">but</span></span> <span class="group2">God</span>'s kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off. <span class="verse"><sup>23 </sup></span>And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for <span class="group2">God</span> has the power to graft them in again. <span class="verse"><sup>24 </sup></span>For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.

<b>The Mystery of Israel's Salvation</b>
<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>25 </sup></span>Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. <span class="verse"><sup>26 </sup></span>And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written,

<span class="verse"><sup>27 </sup></span>“and this will be my covenant with them

<br/><br/>
<span class="verse"><sup>28 </sup></span>As regards the gospel, they are enemies for your sake.

<span class="verse"><sup>33 </sup></span>Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of <span class="group2">God</span>! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
